# Orchestrade Technology Roadmap Presentation

## Introduction

[Slide 1: Title - Orchestrade Technology Roadmap]

Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us at our European Client Forum. Today, I'm excited to share with you Orchestrade's technology roadmap, focusing on how our upcoming innovations will address key challenges and enhance our portfolio management system for hedge funds, sell-side clients, and energy traders.

## Current Status and Challenges

[Slide 2: Current Architecture Overview]

Let's begin by looking at our current system architecture. Orchestrade currently uses Protocol Buffers, or ProtoBuf, for data serialization. We employ reflection to check DLLs and use runtime serialization with byte arrays.

[Slide 3: Serialization Challenge Visualization]

However, we've identified a critical challenge with this setup, particularly when it comes to Serialization and Deserialization, or SerDe for short. Let me illustrate this with a simple example:

Imagine we have two services, A and B, using slightly different versions of our DLLs. If a class is modified between these versions, it can lead to mismatched data mapping. This creates a risk of data misinterpretation, which is clearly unacceptable in the high-stakes world of financial trading.

## Our Innovative Solution

[Slide 4: New Serialization Approach]

To address this, we're implementing a groundbreaking solution: multiple ProtoBuf serializers. This approach allows us to correct serialization issues at runtime, ensuring seamless communication between services, even when they're running different versions.

[Slide 5: Benefits of New Serialization]

The benefits are substantial:

1. Version Compatibility: Different versions can now coexist in the same environment.
2. Seamless Deployment: This paves the way for Blue-Green deployments, minimizing downtime and risk.
3. Enhanced Reliability: Reduced risk of data misinterpretation across services.

## Performance Improvements and Trade Caching

[Slide 6: Trade Caching Challenge]

Now, let's discuss an exciting development in trade caching. As our clients' operations grow, so do their trade caches. Some of our larger clients are now managing up to 80GB of RAM per OrchServer instance just for trade caches.

[Slide 7: New Trade Caching Solution]

To address this, we're introducing a new service similar to our Risk Server. This service will maintain a unified cache copy of trades, significantly reducing the RAM usage per OrchServer instance.

[Slide 8: Benefits of New Trade Caching]

The benefits are clear:

1. Reduced Infrastructure Costs: Lower RAM requirements mean more efficient resource utilization.
2. Scalability: This solution is particularly beneficial for clients handling over 5 million live trades.
3. Improved Performance: Centralized caching can lead to faster data access and processing.

## Streamlining Deployments

[Slide 9: Deployment Tool Engine]

We're also focusing on streamlining our deployment process. Our new Deployment Tool Engine will reduce the number of DLLs necessary for each service, leading to lighter, more efficient deployments.

[Slide 10: Deployment Tool UI]

Complementing this, we're developing a new Deployment Tool UI to simplify the deployment process, making it more intuitive and less error-prone.

## Current Archi and Containers

[Slide 11: Orchestrade Architecture Diagram]

Now, let's discuss an exciting development that we've just rolled out in our latest version this week: the containerization of our entire application stack using Docker.

[Slide 12: Docker Benefits]

Containerization offers several key advantages for Orchestrade and our clients:

1. Consistency: Docker ensures that our application runs the same way across different environments, from development to production. This significantly reduces "it works on my machine" issues.
2. Isolation: Each component of Orchestrade - from the OrchServer to individual microservices - runs in its own container. This isolation improves security and makes it easier to manage dependencies.
3. Scalability: Containers can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, allowing for more efficient resource utilization.
4. Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easier to deploy Orchestrade across different cloud providers or on-premises infrastructure.

[Slide 13: Blue-Green Deployment with Docker]

Now, let's explore how Docker facilitates Blue-Green deployments:

1. Parallel Environments: With Docker, we can easily create identical "Blue" and "Green" environments. The Blue environment represents the current production version, while Green is the new version we want to deploy.
2. Quick Switching: Docker allows us to route traffic between Blue and Green environments rapidly. We can test the Green environment with a subset of users or traffic before fully switching over.
3. Rollback Capability: If issues are detected in the Green environment, we can quickly route traffic back to the Blue environment, minimizing downtime.
4. Resource Efficiency: Docker's lightweight nature means we can run both Blue and Green environments simultaneously without doubling our infrastructure costs.

[Slide 14: Deployment Scenario Example]

Let's walk through a typical Blue-Green deployment scenario with Orchestrade's containerized architecture:

1. We start with our current production environment (Blue) running in Docker containers.
2. We spin up a new set of containers with the updated version (Green).
3. We run tests on the Green environment to ensure everything is working correctly.
4. Gradually, we route some traffic to the Green environment, monitoring for any issues.
5. If everything looks good, we switch all traffic to the Green environment.
6. The Blue environment is kept as a backup for quick rollback if needed.
7. Once we're confident in the new version, we can decommission the old Blue environment.

This approach significantly reduces risk and downtime during updates, ensuring a smoother experience for our clients.

[Slide 15: Additional Containerization Benefits]

Beyond deployment, containerization offers other benefits for Orchestrade:

1. Microservices Architecture: Docker aligns perfectly with our microservices cluster, allowing each service (Events, Position, Payment, etc.) to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
2. Development Efficiency: Developers can work with production-like environments on their local machines, speeding up development and testing.
3. Resource Optimization: The OrchServer's Data Access Layer and Cache can be more precisely allocated resources based on client needs.
4. Easier Updates: We can update individual components (like the Risk Server/Grid) without affecting the entire system.

In conclusion, the move to Docker represents a significant step forward in Orchestrade's technology stack. It not only improves our deployment process but also enhances the overall flexibility, scalability, and efficiency of our platform.

## Conclusion

[Slide Final: Roadmap Summary]

To wrap up, our technology roadmap is focused on:

1. Enhancing data integrity and version compatibility
2. Optimizing performance and resource utilization
3. Streamlining deployment processes

These improvements are designed to make Orchestrade more robust, efficient, and user-friendly, directly addressing the evolving needs of our diverse client base.

Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to take any questions you may have.
