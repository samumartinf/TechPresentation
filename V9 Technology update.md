## Recent Enhancements and Improvements

[Slide 1: Application Enhancements Overview]

I'm pleased to announce that we have added **2000 new enhancements** to the Orchestrade application. These enhancements are designed to improve user experience, streamline workflows, and introduce new features that cater to our clients' evolving needs.

[Slide 2: Bug Fixes]

In addition to new features, we have successfully **removed 3600 bugs** from the application. This significant reduction in bugs not only enhances the stability of our platform but also ensures a smoother experience for our users.

[Slide 3: Migration to .NET 8]

We have fully migrated from **.NET 6 to .NET 8**. This upgrade brings several improvements, particularly in performance and security. .NET 8 introduces enhanced performance optimizations, which lead to faster application execution and reduced resource consumption. Additionally, it includes advanced security features that help protect against modern threats, ensuring that our clients' data remains secure.

[Slide 4: Dockerization of the Application]

We have also fully **dockerized the application**. This transition to a containerized architecture allows for more efficient deployments and easier testing environments. With Docker, we can create isolated environments for testing new versions of Orchestrade, ensuring that updates can be rolled out with minimal risk and downtime. This flexibility enhances our ability to deliver new features and fixes rapidly.

[Slide 5: Enhanced SSO Support]

Finally, we have added further support for **Single Sign-On (SSO)** solutions, including **Entra ID from Azure, Okta, and more**. This enhancement simplifies the authentication process for our users, allowing them to access Orchestrade seamlessly while maintaining robust security protocols.

In conclusion, these updates reflect our commitment to continuous improvement and our dedication to providing a high-performance, secure, and user-friendly platform for our clients.
